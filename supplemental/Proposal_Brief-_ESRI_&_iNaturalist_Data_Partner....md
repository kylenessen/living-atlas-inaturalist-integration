# Brief: ESRI & iNaturalist Partnership for Environmental Review

## 1. The Problem: Inaccessible Critical Data

Environmental review processes currently rely on incomplete and outdated data for locating sensitive species. This is a significant issue in California and likely across the United States and other developed countries.

- **The Best Data is Locked:** iNaturalist has the most comprehensive and recent data on rare species. However, their policy is to obscure the location data for all regionally sensitive species by default.
- **Impact on Reviews:** This policy prevents environmental professionals from using the best available information. Desktop reviews, which determine the scope of necessary field surveys, are therefore based on inferior data.

Fundamentally, a critical dataset for environmental protection is not being utilized because of a policy decision.

## 2. The Solution: An Exclusive ESRI & iNaturalist Partnership

ESRI, as the dominant player in the GIS market (used in ~98% of desktop reviews), is uniquely positioned to solve this.

- **The Proposal:** ESRI provides funding to iNaturalist in exchange for exclusive professional access to their **unobscured** sensitive species location data.
- **Distribution:** This high-value dataset would be distributed exclusively through the ESRI Living Atlas.
- **Immediate Value:** This would instantly create a compelling data product for professionals. It would more than double the available information on sensitive species and provide the freshest data available (e.g., 96% of records from the last three years).

## 3. Win-Win-Win Scenarios

### ESRI Wins:

- **Adds Immediate Value:** ESRI would provide a real value-added layer that environmental review professionals can immediately incorporate into their workflows.
- **Drives Adoption:** Easy distribution through the Living Atlas will ensure high adoption. Once regulators see the wealth of new information, they will likely mandate its use.
- **Solidifies Market Position:** Mandated use would compel any company conducting environmental reviews to use ESRI software, reinforcing market dominance.

### iNaturalist Wins:

- **Secures Financial Support:** The partnership provides continued financial support, ensuring the sustainability of iNaturalist's mission and infrastructure.
- **Preserves a Great Project:** This funding helps preserve what is one of the great public data projects on the internet, allowing it to continue funding its core mission and ancillary benefits.

### The Public Wins:

- **Keeps a Public Good Alive:** Like Wikipedia, iNaturalist is a public good. However, its operational costs (hosting millions of photos and global servers) are far greater. ESRI's funding helps keep the platform free for public use.
- **Prevents Monetization:** This partnership provides a sustainable funding model that prevents iNaturalist from needing to become a paid service or ceasing to exist.
