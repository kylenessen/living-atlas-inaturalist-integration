# Proposal: iNaturalist & Esri Collaboration for Sensitive Species Data

This document outlines a proposed collaboration between iNaturalist and Esri to make sensitive species data available for environmental review, creating a win-win scenario for both organizations and for environmental protection.

## 1. The Problem: Critical Environmental Data is Inaccessible

In environmental compliance, consultants conduct reviews to identify sensitive species that could potentially occur on a project site. This process is fundamental for permitting and relies heavily on species occurrence data.

- **Current Data Sources:** In California, this involves querying datasets like the California Natural Diversity Database (CNDDB), the California Native Plant Society (CNPS) Rare Plant Inventory, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) data.
- **The Missing Piece:** iNaturalist is the world's largest citizen science project, with over 450 million observations. It represents the most current and abundant source of species occurrence data.
- **The Core Issue:** iNaturalist, by policy, obscures the locations of sensitive taxa to prevent misuse. This well-intentioned decision has the unintended consequence of removing this vital data source from the environmental review process. As a result, consulting firms and regulators ignore iNaturalist data, leading to environmental reports based on incomplete or outdated information.

## 2. Proof of Concept: A Data Analysis Project

To demonstrate the scale of this missed opportunity, a data science project can quantify the importance of iNaturalist's contribution.

- **Objective:** Show that iNaturalist is the primary source of recent sensitive species data in California.
- **Methodology:**
  1.  Randomly sample a set of sensitive taxa in California.
  2.  Query occurrence records from the last three years across multiple sources: iNaturalist, CNDDB, and GBIF (representing other herbaria).
  3.  Create visualizations (e.g., bar graphs, time series) comparing the proportion of observations from each source, both for all-time records and for the last three years.
- **Hypothesis:** The analysis will confirm that the majority of recent observations come from iNaturalist, proving that the most current data is being systematically ignored in environmental reviews.

## 3. The Solution: A Strategic Partnership

Esri can provide a platform to unlock this data for professional use while respecting iNaturalist's security concerns.

- **The Mechanism:** iNaturalist provides Esri with exclusive access to its unobscured sensitive species occurrence data.
- **The Product:** Esri integrates this data as a premium, authoritative layer within the ArcGIS Living Atlas.
- **The Access Model:** Access to this data layer would be restricted to licensed Esri users. This creates a paid barrier, similar to the existing subscription model for CNDDB, which provides a precedent for this approach. This controlled access gives iNaturalist cover and reassurance that the data is not being released freely to the public.

## 4. The Value Proposition: A Win-Win-Win-Win

This collaboration creates significant value for all parties involved.

- **Esri Wins:**
  - **Exclusive Data Product:** Acquires a critical and unique dataset that will be indispensable for environmental review.
  - **Ecosystem Lock-in:** Strengthens the value of the Esri platform, making it essential for environmental firms and potentially driving new license adoption.

- **iNaturalist Wins:**
  - **Sustainable Funding:** Creates a revenue stream from the partnership, helping to secure the long-term financial health of iNaturalist as a public good, much like a non-profit.
  - **Mission Advancement:** Fulfills its conservation mission by ensuring its data leads to better environmental outcomes through a secure, controlled channel.

- **The Environment Wins:**
  - **Better Science:** Environmental reports will be based on the most comprehensive and up-to-date data available.
  - **Improved Outcomes:** Better data leads to better-informed decisions and more effective environmental protections.

- **The Public Wins:**
  - **Secures a Public Good:** The partnership helps ensure the continued existence of iNaturalist, a globally significant platform for citizen science and public engagement with nature.
