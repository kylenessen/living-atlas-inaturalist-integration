# Analysis of a Potential iNaturalist-Esri Collaboration

## 1. iNaturalist as a Public Good with High Costs

iNaturalist is a public good, similar in spirit to Wikipedia. However, its operational resource requirements are significantly higher, raising questions about whether a donation-based model alone is sufficient for long-term sustainability. 

Significant corporate sponsorship from a partner like Esri would go a long way toward ensuring the project's continued existence and growth.

## 2. The Moral Imperative to Share Data

Following the theme of Scott Loarie's TED Talk, iNaturalist is a crucial tool for helping to solve the extinction crisis. This creates a strong moral argument for making its most valuable data—specifically rare and sensitive species data—available to the people and organizations who can use it for conservation.

Currently, this vital data is largely inaccessible; an estimated 96% of recent occurrence records are not available for public review.

## 3. The Collaboration Framework: A Mutually Beneficial Partnership

The core of the collaboration is a trade of financial support for data access and positive public relations.

### What iNaturalist Gains:
*   **Financial Sustainability**: Esri's sponsorship provides the resources needed to sustain and grow the project.

### What Esri Gains:
*   **Access to Sensitive Conservation Data**: The primary product for Esri is access to iNaturalist's locked sensitive species data, such as the rare plant data product. While this may not be a directly commercial product, it holds immense value.
*   **Powerful PR & Marketing Angle**: The partnership allows Esri to build a compelling narrative around its commitment to conservation.
    *   **Addressing the Extinction Crisis**: Esri can be positioned as a key corporate partner in the global effort to fight extinction.
    *   **Shared Mission**: The collaboration demonstrates that Esri shares iNaturalist's conservation goals.
    *   **Enabling a Public Good**: Esri would be credited with helping make a vital public good possible and providing the conservation community with access to critical data.
